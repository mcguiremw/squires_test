# QA Assessment
## Objectives
This exercise includes a proposed solution for the Tasks outlined in the `README.dev.md`. In this exercise you'll run the proposed solution and evaluate its validity based on the requirements outlined (Tasks) in `README.dev.md`.

* Setup automated integration tests for the running assessment API based on the outlined Task requirements
* Identify (the tests will identify) failing expectations, security issues, and any other issue deemed relevant
* Tests should cover all outlined expectations in the Task

Please refer to the `Running the API with Swagger UI` section below to run the proposed solution that you will be putting under test. We've provided you with a Swagger UI interface to facilitate the use of the API so you can quickly get in and start seeing what's available, what works, and what doesn't.

## Important notes
* You are free to use whatever testing setup/framework/language you prefer. We just ask that you provide instructions on how to run your tests.

* If you are not able to complete the above, no worries. This is not an all or nothing deal. Please just provide an explanation of what you tried, what worked, what didn't, what you would do in a perfect world.

* We don't expect there to be any issues but, if you run into an error or issue with what we've provided, please note it and complete what you can if you are unable to correct or work around it. 

## Submission
Please provide us with a link to the repository that we'll be able to access. Thanks in advance, we really appreciate it. Your submission should include instructions on how to run your tests.

# Running the API with Swagger UI
1. Follow the directions for `Running with Docker` in `README.dev.md`
2. Navigate to `localhost:8100/doc/swagger` to find a SwaggerUI for the API (the API itself will be available at `localhost:8100` as indicated in `README.dev.md`)
